# ESP32-Arduino-UNO-Wi-Fi-Resistance-Meter
This project measures an unknown resistorâ€™s value using an Arduino UNO and displays the result wirelessly on a webpage hosted by an ESP32 in Access Point (AP) mode. The system automatically rounds measured resistance to the nearest standard E24 value and updates the display in real time.
